# odin-recipes

This is a small project for a recipe website. It should contain a few links to various recipes once completed.

My goal for this project is to demonstrate that I have the skills to set up a basic webpage from scratch.
I should also use this as an opportunity to learn good processes when it comes to committing to github:
    -make meaningful commits
    -make proper comments to any commits I make, lay them out with a brief subject line outlining the change, as well as a body describing specifically what changed and why.
