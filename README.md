# odin-recipes

This is a small project for a recipe website. It should contain a few links to various recipes once completed.

My goal for this project is to demonstrate that I can use the html fundamentals I have learned so far to set up a basic webpage from scratch.
I will also use this as an opportunity to learn good habbits when committing to github.
