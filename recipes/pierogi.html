            <h3>A plate of Polish Pierogi</h3>
            <p>A tradtional Polish dish and a family favourite. These can be quite a lot of work <br>so are normally only made for special occasions/holidays.
                Simple ingredients<br> and a bit of elbow grease result in a fantastic little dish. These are best served <br>fried, but do have to be boiled first.
            </p>

                <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                
                <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook<br> and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed<br> potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li><br>
                <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth.<br> Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream<br> mixture until dough comes together.</li><br>
                <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li><br>
                <li>Roll out dough to 3mm thickness. Cut into 7.5cm rounds using a biscuit<br> cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</li><br>
                <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal.</li><br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches<br> to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove<br> with a slotted spoon.</li><br>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
