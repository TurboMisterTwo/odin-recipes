        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <li>1 head cabbage, cored</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>450g minced pork</li>
                <li>225g minced beef</li>
                <li>350g cooked rice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li><small>1/4</small> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>300g can condensed tomato soup</li>
                <li>350ml tomato juice</li>
                <li>117g ketchup</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place cabbage head<br> into the pot, cover, and cook until leaves are softened enough to remove from the<br> head, about 3 minutes. Remove cabbage from the pot and let sit until leaves are<br> cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Remove 18 whole leaves from the cabbage head, cutting out any thick tough<br> center ribs. Set whole leaves aside. Chop the remaining cabbage and spread it in<br> the bottom of a casserole dish.</li><br>
                <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saut√©<br> until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Combine beef, pork, cooked rice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.<br> Add onion and mix until well combined.</li><br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C.</li><br>
                <li>Place about 120g pork mixture onto a cabbage leaf. Roll the leaf around<br> beef mixture, tucking in the sides to create an envelope around the meat. Repeat<br> to make remaining cabbage rolls. Place cabbage rolls in a layer over chopped<br> cabbage in the casserole dish. Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
                <li>Whisk condensed soup, tomato juice, and ketchup together in a bowl; pour<br> over cabbage rolls and cover the dish tightly with tin foil.                </li><br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked<br> through, about 1 hour. Uncover for the last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking. An<br> instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 70 degrees C.</li><br>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
